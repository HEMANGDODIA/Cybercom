Today,I learn some new feture of github and some command of git.

1) I learn extra feture like restore and other command like
$git log :- which one is usefull for show all details of commited words and it also show Head no which is use for revert commited data
$git revert  Head no:- using this command we can restore or retrive all data throgh Head no (including merge also)
 
=> one task was gave by sir which is:

-if I have one main branch and one another branch main1.
-so i can switch main to main1 then if I can change file data in main1 after commit  & push 
-merge this main1 branch to main branch and push.
-after then i can again change in main1 then commit for that I see diff using $git diff .
-so for that i can use fetch command($git fetch origin main1) for add change data .

for follwing task i learn and follow this step

=>other think I was learn is

-whenever we want to recover 15 days ago data then use headno of merge command  then using $git revert  headno.

Today, I did know about diffent query for git command.

-->like difference between rebase and merge means Git rebase moves a feature branch into a master. 
-Git merge adds a new commit, preserving the history so that using Git rebase we can't able to revent data

-->After that I learn different type vof reset like soft,hard and mixed and it's use and also clear difference between reset and revent 
-we can say that reset affects all files in the current branch on the repository, not just those in your current directory. 
-Reset only discards changes that haven't been committed yet. 
-where  git revert command is a forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. 
Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.

so today we get some useful information from sir for how can we carefully use git 
1. git command configure like improve message rading capability
2. some basic & import command => add commit push log
